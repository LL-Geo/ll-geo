### 大家好！ Hello! 😉 


I'm a postdoc and a geophysicist at the University of Western Australia, modelling the lithospheric structure of the North Australian Craton and trying to link petrophysics with geophysics. 🦘

  I completed my PhD in Australia as well, 🐧, and used geophysics to understand the interaction between the solid earth and the cryosphere. It's quite challenging but really fun!!
